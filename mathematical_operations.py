# mathematical operations

a=20
b=58
c=90

print(a,b,c)

x=a+(b+c*a)

print(x)
j=a**b # a raised to b i.e, 20 raised to 58
print(j)
# floor division is dividing one number by another and then rounding it to the closest that is smaller
i=a//b
print(i)
print(a+b)#this will also work if dont wanna assign a value
